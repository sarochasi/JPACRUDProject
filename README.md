## Eight-Thousanders CRUD Application

### Overview

The Eight-Thousanders CRUD Application is designed to perform simple Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on a database of the world's 14 highest peaks, known as the eight-thousanders. This application allows users to view the list of peaks, view details of each mountain, edit mountain information, delete mountains, and add new peaks to the database.

### Learning Objectives

* Creating a SQL Database and Tables: Designing and setting up a SQL database with appropriate tables for storing data about the eight-thousanders.
* Configuring a JPA Project: Setting up a Java Persistence API (JPA) project to interact with the SQL database.
* Mapping Entities to SQL Tables: Creating entity classes and mapping them to SQL tables for CRUD operations.
* Creating JUnit Tests: Writing unit tests to verify the correctness of JPA entity mappings and database interactions.
* Integrating Spring MVC with JPA: Combining Spring MVC with JPA to handle web requests and perform CRUD operations on the database.
* Performing Basic CRUD Operations**: Implementing basic CRUD functionality for managing the eight-thousanders data.

### Technologies Used

* Java: Programming language used for the application.
* Spring MVC: Framework for building web applications.
* JPA (Java Persistence API): For mapping Java objects to database tables.
* Hibernate: JPA implementation used for ORM (Object-Relational Mapping).
* MySQL: Database management system for storing data.
* Bootstrap: Front-end framework for styling the web pages.
* JUnit: Framework for writing unit tests.

### Lessons Learned

* Database Design: Understanding the importance of designing a relational database schema that effectively supports CRUD operations.
* JPA Configuration: Gaining experience in configuring JPA for ORM and mapping Java entities to database tables.
* Spring MVC Integration: Learning how to integrate Spring MVC with JPA to create a web application that performs CRUD operations.
* Error Handling: Implementing robust error handling and validation mechanisms in both the back-end and front-end.
* Testing: Writing and executing JUnit tests to ensure that the applicationâ€™s database interactions and mappings are functioning correctly.
